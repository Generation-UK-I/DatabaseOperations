# Database Project

If you have not already done so, you should create your own GitHub portfolio in order to showcase your skills and knowledge, and one of the examples of work you should show is databases.

One of the more challenging areas of working in tech can be interconnecting different technologies, so this is what we want to be able to demonstrate to employers.

At this point you should have a version of your Coffee Shop Python app, so try moving your shop's inventory to a database for retrieving the current stock, and submitting orders.

In the workplace you will face challenges, you will be expected to solve problems, and you will use tools which are unfamiliar. Support will be available, but the people to whom you would reach out have their own responsibilities and work to do, so you should try to minimise interruptions. This is what we're trying to simulate just a little bit.

Some tips:
- Spend some time re-familiarising yourself with your code and it's logic.
- Plan your database tables and schema so that it will hold the necessary data.
- Carefully consider the exact SQL statements you need to write to carry out the operations. - How will you form the SQL statements in Python?
- How do you connect Python and MySQL together?

**Remember:**
- You may not get it fully finished, that's fine, it's a journey not a race, go at your own pace to maximise learning.
- Use whatever resources are available, Google, GenAI, colleagues, etc. Just don't let them do it for you!
- If you've hit a brick wall, reach out to your instructor.
