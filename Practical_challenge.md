# Practical Challenge
## Model a Company

For this challenge you basically need to experiment. You can either:

1. Think of a different organisation, consider their data recording needs, plan your tables schemas, then populate with sample records.
2. Start with the examples we've used so far, but build them out. Expand the tables, design new queries, utilise joins to create reports, and so on...

Some examples of how you might build the DB out include:
- Add an employees table, customers, and products table, an orders table with foreign keys to linking them together, then an orders table which queries the others to identify the customer, product, and employee who made the sale.
- With orders in your table, can create queries which will, for example, calculate the sum of sales for a particular employee? Or calculate the total revenue from a specific product?
- Calculate an employee comission based on sales totals.
- Expand the customers table with more fields, and create queries which will generate shipping labels.

Anything else you can think of.
